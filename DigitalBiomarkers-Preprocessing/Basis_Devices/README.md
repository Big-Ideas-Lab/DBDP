Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of basis device data from the "Digital Health: Tracking Physiomes and Activity Using Wearable Biosensors Reveals Useful Health-Related Information" paper. Data is available at: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402#sec014. 

Devices included Basis B1, Basis Peak, and Scanadu. Basis device data were made available by the authors, with four parameters: time in the format MM/DD/YYYY h:min:s -UTC, heart rate (hr) in beats per minute, acceleration magnitude (accel_magnitude), skin temperature (skin_temp) in degree Fahrenheit. Some participant's data was split into two files so they were merged together before inputting into the code. Additional parameters, such as steps, activity, and calories, were analyzed in this study. Other parameters, such as food logging, continuous glucose metrics, and galvanic skin response, were collected but were not analyzed in this study.
