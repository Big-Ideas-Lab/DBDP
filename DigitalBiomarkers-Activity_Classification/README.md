# Activity Classification

**Objectives:** Classify aerobic vs. strength vs. other activities using:
1. _Scalable_ activity labeling for supervised modeling
2. _Accessible_ wearable device data, specifically Fitbit data
3. _Systematic_ exploration of steps and heart rate features

**Organization:** This project is part of the **Big Ideas Lab at Duke University**. We collaborated with the **DISCOVeR Lab at Stanford University**, which conducted the Strong-D study. The Strong-D Fitbit data set was used to develop and evaluate this activity classification model.

#### Code Available Now:
This project is ongoing and the relevant Strong-D code currently resides here: https://github.com/Big-Ideas-Lab/strongd/tree/master/activity_prediction

The next steps include generalizing this code into a DBDP module.
