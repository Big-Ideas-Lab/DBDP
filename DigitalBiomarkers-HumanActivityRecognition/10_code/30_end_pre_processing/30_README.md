We took two steps for preprocessing:

1. In 31_remove_outliers, we remove data that is physiologically impossible.

2. 32_engineer_features, we engineer features or manipulate our data to better suit our machine or deep learning models. Some of these methods include feature engineering, rolling, and creating a 'super row' table.
