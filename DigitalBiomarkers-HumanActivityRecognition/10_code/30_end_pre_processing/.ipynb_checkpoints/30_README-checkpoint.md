This folder is easy. 

1. We're taking all of the data and getting rid of some things that are just no good (31_remove_outliers)

2. Then, we're taking that data with the removed stuff and altering it in the hopes we get better results (32_engineer_features)

The file used in the 31_remove_outliers folder is the Aggregated Patient .csv w/ Activity Label (30_all_partic_aggregated_with_activity.csv).

The file used in the 32_engineer_features folder is the CSV output of 31_outlier_removal.ipynb (plain_data.csv)
