__RF Functions (61_rf_functions.ipynb)__:
This notebook contains functions for the Random Forest w/ LOOCV. It also contains code for evaluating feature importances from the random forest. These functions are modular and can be adapted to your own classification needs. The model is built on the individual raw signal data __(plain_data.csv)__, but we only used it for feature importances and not accuracy itself.

__RF w/ Individual Data (62_rf_individual.ipynb)__:
This notebook is composed of a random forest classification model to evaluate a general accuracy level of traditional ML methods in classifying our HAR data based on activity. The model is built on the individual raw signal data __(plain_data.csv)__. 


__RF w/ Feature-Engineered Rolled Data (63_rf_feature_engineering.ipynb)__:
This notebook is composed of a random forest classification model to evaluate a general accuracy level of traditional ML methods in classifying our HAR data based on activity. The model is built on sliding window data with engineered features __(engineered_features.csv)__.
