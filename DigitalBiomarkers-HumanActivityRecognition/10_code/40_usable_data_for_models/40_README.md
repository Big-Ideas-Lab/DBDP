We have been working entirely with the STEP Dataset so far. It comes from this study: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0226-6

Go in the 50_deep_learning folder to find the PAMAP2 model template that will make the data required for another dataset. The link for the dataset is here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PAMAP2+Physical+Activity+Monitoring. You can clean it yourself using the functions from this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/avrahamcalev/time-series-models-pamap2-dataset.
