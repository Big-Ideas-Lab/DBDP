The file with all of the data in a nice dataframe is in here. It starts with a 30, which might be a little confusing since this is the 20 folder. Ignore that. It is primarily used in the 30 folder to finish preprocessing according to things we found in the EDA.

Use the notebook in this folder to have a guided tour of the data in 30_all_partic_aggregated_with_activity.csv

There are also some Tableau files that you can explore if you know how to use Tableau, but don't worry if you don't. The notebook 20_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb has everything you need. Feel free to do your own exploring!

If your data is in the same structure as 30_all_partic_aggregated_with_activity.csv, you will be able to use this notebook to do your own EDA, but you might have to change some variable names.
