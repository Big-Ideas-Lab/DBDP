# Human Activity Recognition using Physiological Data from Wearables

**Objectives:**
Human activity recognition (HAR) is a rapidly expanding field with a variety of applications from biometric authentication to developing home-based rehabilitation for people suffering from traumatic brain injuries. While HAR is traditionally performed using accelerometry data, a team of students led by researchers in the BIG IDEAS Lab will explore HAR with physiological data from wrist wearables. Using deep learning methods, students will extract features from wearable sensor data to classify human activity. The student team will develop a reproducible machine learning model that will be integrated into the Big Ideas Lab Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP), which is a source of code for researchers and clinicians developing digital biomarkers from wearable sensors and mobile health technologies.

This project is in partnership with the Rhodes Information Iniative Data+ undergraduate summer research program. For more information on this project : https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/human-activity-recognition-using-physiological-data-wearables
