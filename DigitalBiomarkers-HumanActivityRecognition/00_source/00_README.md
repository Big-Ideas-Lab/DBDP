This module begins with preprocessing data from the Empatica E4 wearable, though it does not start from the raw data. For preprocessing required to get to this step, you'll have to look at earlier modules in the pipeline. 

The data used in this module is available upon request. Please contact Brinnae Bent (brinnae.bent@duke.edu) or Dr. Jessilyn Dunn (jessilyn.dunn@duke.edu).
