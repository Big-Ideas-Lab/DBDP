### 3.3. End Preprocessing (30_end_pre_processing folder)
### Methods
1. Remove rows of data where the Apple Watch sensors were used instead of the Empatica E4 sensor, to allow for a consistent sampling rate among the data without the need for extra interpolation. 
2. Remove Subject ID 19-028 from data because activity key stated that their rounds were flipped, but when flipped this resulted in an odd amount of rows of data
3. Create a rolling analysis of our time series data, which is used to capture our sensor instability over time 
4. Compute parameter estimates over a rolling window of a fixed size through the sample
5. Add 'super rows' to your code which will also include all sensor readings and activity, Subject ID, and round labels for the next time point, attempt to bypass data augmentation. 
6. Engineer features of our rolled data that will be used in the Random Forest models & Deep Learning Models. 
***
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.1. Outlier Removal (31_outlier_removal.ipynb)
This notebook removes rows of data where the Apple Watch sensors were used instead of the Empatica E4 sensor, to allow for a consistent sampling rate among the data without the need for extra interpolation. Using the aggregated file, it outputs:
1. .csv without Apple Watch Data: label rounds 1 & 2 separated 
2. .csv without Apple Watch Data: label rounds 1 & 2 combined
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.2. Feature Engineering (31_roll_timepoints.ipynb, 32_super.ipynb, 33_feature_engineering.ipynb)
1. __31_roll_timepoints.ipynb__ contains our procedure for creating a rolling analysis of our time series data, which is used to capture our sensor instability over time. A common technique to assess the constancy of a modelâ€™s parameters is to compute parameter estimates over a rolling window of a fixed size through the sample. As the sensor parameters due to some variability in time sampling, the rolling estimates should capture this instability. 
2. __32_super.ipynb__ provides code to add 'super rows' to your code. Each row will also include all sensor readings and activity, Subject ID, and round labels for the next time point. The goal is to include other time points as features for each row, without relying on other data augmentation methods that reduce the total amount of data, such as windowing, rolling, or aggregating. 
3. __33_feature_engineering.ipynb__ outlines the process for engineering features of our data that will be used in the Random Forest models. The five types of features we created are window mean, standard deviation, skew, minimum, and maximum.

![Deep Learning Pipeline](https://github.com/Big-Ideas-Lab/Data-2020/blob/master/30_docs/DataPipeline.png)
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5.1. Model Templates (51_model_templates folder)
Provides just the data preparation needed to input data into any neural network, split by data source

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5.2. Pytorch Models (52_pytorch_models folder)
Contains ANN models for both the STEP and PAMAP2 data.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5.3. Tensorflow Models (53_tensorflow_models folder)
Contains a multitude of deep learning models that have a specific notebook for each data source. Also has model files for each model run, including models with only mechanical, phyiological, and all sensors. These models use the STEP dataset which is also refered to as the Duke dataset. 
#### 1. ANN (10_ANN.ipynb) 
This artificial neural network has 2 hidden fully connected layers with a dropout layer between them to prevent overfitting. The finaly fully connected layer classifies each timepoint fed into the model into 4 classes. This model uses leave-one-person-out validation. With this model we are able to compare the difference between including only mechanical sensors, only physiological sensors, or both. 
#### 2. ANN with feature engineering (20_ANN_WFE.ipynb) 
This model uses engineered features from 20 second windows, with 10 second overlap. The engineered features are min, max, mean, standard deviation of our sensor values during these windows of time. The model consists of 6 hidden fully connected layers, a dropout layer and uses leave-one-person-out validation. With this model we are able to compare the difference between including only mechanical sensors, only physiological sensors, or both. 

### 3.6. Random Forests (60_random_forests folder)

This notebook contains functions for the Random Forest w/ LOOCV. It also contains code for evaluating feature importances from the random forest. These functions are modular and can be adapted to your own classification needs. The model is built on the rolling average data with engineered features and helped us calculate feature importances, compare ACC+PHYS vs ACC-Only models, and incorporate LOOCV. 
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6.2. RF w/ Individual Data (62_rf_individual.ipynb)
This notebook is composed of a random forest classification model to evaluate a general accuracy level of traditional ML methods in classifying our HAR data based on activity. The model is built on the individual raw signal data.

## 4. The Results (20_results)
***
These are the overall best results for our models using balanced classes. Higher accuracy and F1 score was actually achieved for ANN_WFE when using our imbalanced dataset. This points to the idea that our models metrics could possibly be improved with more data as currently only 505 rows of data are fed into ANN_WFE for each class during training.  

| Model Name    | Data Input Type            | Data Source | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| ANN_WFE          | Feature Engineered Windows | STEP        | 0.81     | 0.80     |
| Random Forest | Feature Engineered Windows | STEP        | 0.84     | 0.81     |
| ANN           | Individual Timepoints      | STEP        | 0.64     | 0.61     |
| ANN           | Individual Timepoints      | PAMAP2      | 0.96     | 0.96     |  

**Accuracy Comparisons**

![**Model and Sensor Comparisons**](https://github.com/Big-Ideas-Lab/Data-2020/blob/master/20_results/40_other_figures/overall_accuracy_v2.png)

The figure above displays the overall F1 scores for our Random Forest, ANN, and ANN with feature engineered windows. The highest F1 score achieved is the ANN_WFE model only using accelerometry data. 


**Confusion Matrix Results: ANN_WFE**
![**Confusion Matrix Comparison for ANN_WFE**](https://github.com/Big-Ideas-Lab/Data-2020/blob/master/20_results/20_confusion_matrix/20_ANN_WFE/ANN_WFE_CF_results.png)

**Accuracy Results: ANN_WFE**
|                     | Accuracy | Accuracy SD | F1   | F1 SD |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| All Sensors         | 0.81    | 0.12       | 0.79 | 0.14  |
| Accelerometry Only  | 0.84    | 0.11       | 0.83 | 0.12  |
| Physiological Only  | 0.60    | 0.16       | 0.57 | 0.18  |

Based on our ANN_WFE model, it appears that the addition of physiological data does not improve the model. The results shown in the table above are based on our leave-one-person-out validation. Interestingly, It appears that only physiological sensors are unable to classify the class, "activity" well. Classification for the class, "Type", is strong regardless of the kind of sensors used.
